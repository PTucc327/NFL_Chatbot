# Teaser Team Progress

Current Progress:
1. Testing generative AI models: Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Meta-llama/Llama-3-.2-3B-Instruct, Deepseek AI, Microsoft/Phi-4-mini-instruct, and OpenAI ChatGPT
2. Recording findings such as outputs, resource usage and if any modifications need to be made on the model to use
3. Using sample data and 3 different prompts for testing various models.

Future additions:
1. Utilize 3 years of Financial data from an actual company for testing models and gauging quality of output
2. Utilize Ollama for testing models
3. Fine-tune the prompts being used, move away from vague prompts and try to get more meaningful responses involving the financial numbers and possibly the idea of the industry
